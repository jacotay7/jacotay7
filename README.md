## Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸŒŒ

Hello! I'm Jacob, a software engineer with a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from the University of Toronto (2024). My thesis work was in the field of adaptive optics (AO), where I mainly focussed on real-time control. For my thesis, I also worked on Adaptive Secondary Mirror (ASM) calibration techniques, AI-enhanced control for AO, infrared camera characterization (SAPHIRA), and AO bench design.

I work as the AO Software Engineer at the W. M. Keck Observatory on the big island of Hawaii, a role I've held since 2025. My position at Keck is a unique combination of software engineering and AO development. I am a member of both departments and have been learning from both.

### About My Work

I lead the development of **pyRTC**, an open-source project I started during my PhD. **pyRTC** focuses on delivering high-performance real-time control using only Python. PyRTC aims to combine performance with usability and is particularly suited for advanced control methods, including AI-enhanced controllers.

I'm looking for collaborators interested in contributing to this project. If you're passionate about open-source software and want to be part of the pyRTC community, I'd love to hear from you.

Currently, I am working on several Keck AO development projects, including HAKA, KAPA, KASM, and the AO refurbishment project. As part of these projects, I am developing tools for tomographic reconstruction, visualizations, software infrastructure and Keck simulations.

### Other Projects

I am also the lead developer for the **veta** project. **veta** is an open-source project for scoring the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS). The LEAS is a multi-lingual psychiatric test designed to gauge emotional awareness, which has been associated with a broad range of clinical psychiatric disorders. **veta** has been featured in several peer-reviewed publications in medical journals, several of which can be found linked on my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6356-567X).

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to collaboration opportunities. Whether you're an experienced developer or new to the field, there's a place for you in the pyRTC project.

Feel free to contact me at [jtaylor@keck.hawaii.edu](mailto:jtaylor@keck.hawaii.edu). Looking forward to connecting!

Thanks for reading!
